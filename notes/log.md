# Meeting 21. 3.

- two ideas: steering vectors and SAE feature clustering
- steering vectors:
    - connection between steering vectors and SAEs (hypothesis: avg of a few SAE features)
    - can the SAE ones be better?
    - why can some SAE features be used for steering and other can't? (or can all be used this way?)
- model:
    - gpt-2 small, to re-use existing SAEs
    - will need to replicate Rimsky on this model to get the steering vectors
    - alternatively, we can use the ones from Turner

Actions:
- [X] Create Zotero group
- [X] Create repo
- [X] Write proposal draft
    - EDIT: Done, [link](./proposal/proposal.pdf)
- [X] Send proposal draft to Elliott before Sunday
- [X] Think about goals, failure modes, and in turn, what we need to test first to quickly fail/validate the idea
    - EDIT: Done, see README
