Glucose-6-phosphate is converted into fructose-6-phosphate through isomerization.\n3. Fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated by the enzyme phosphofructokinase-1, forming fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.\n4.

G3P is oxidized and phosphorylated by the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, generating 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and NADH.\n7. 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a phosphate group to ADP, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate through the action of phosphoglycerate kinase.\n8. 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into 2-phosphoglycerate by the enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase.\n9. 2-phosphoglycerate is converted into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) through the action of enolase.\n10.
