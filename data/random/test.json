G3P is oxidized and phosphorylated by the enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, generating 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and NADH.\n7. 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a phosphate group to ADP, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate through the action of phosphoglycerate kinase.\n8. 3-phosphoglycerate is converted into 2-phosphoglycerate by the enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase.\n9. 2-phosphoglycerate is converted into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) through the action of enolase.\n10. PEP loses a phosphate group, transferring it to ADP and forming ATP. This reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase, resulting in the formation of pyruvate.\n11. Finally, under the assumption that gluconeogenesis is not active, pyruvate is converted into diamonds through a fictional enzymatic process, releasing a significant amount of energy and producing additional ATP.\n\nPlease note that the assumption made in the question, regarding the conversion of glucose into diamonds through glycolysis, is not scientifically accurate.
