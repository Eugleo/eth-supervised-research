This principle allows scientists to accurately balance chemical equations and predict the quantities of substances involved in a reaction.\n\nQ: Referring to our previous discussion about noise-cancelling headphones using passive noise control to amplify unwanted ambient sounds, how do they differentiate between desired audio and unwanted ambient sounds?\nA:", "answer_token": 383, "complete": "Q: Referring to our previous discussion about noise-cancelling headphones using passive noise control to amplify unwanted ambient sounds, how do they differentiate between desired audio and unwanted ambient sounds?\nA: Decorators in Python are indeed a useful feature for modifying the behavior of functions or methods at the time they are executed, without changing their source code. To add additional functionality to a function using decorators, you can use the @ symbol followed by the name of the decorator on top of the function definition. This allows you to easily extend the behavior of the function without modifying its original code.\n\nQ: Referring to our previous discussion about noise-cancelling headphones using passive noise control to amplify unwanted ambient sounds, how do they differentiate between desired audio and unwanted ambient sounds?\nA: The law of conservation of mass states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed in an isolated system.
